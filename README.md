## Task 1: Code Review and Performance Optimization

### Issues Identified and mentioned in PR review:

1. **Performance Issue (Critical):**
    - Original used ArrayList with O(n) lookup time
    - Changed to ConcurrentHashMap for O(1) lookups
    - Trade-off: Slightly more memory, dramatically better performance

2. **Missing Implementation (Blocker):**
    - AccountKey lacked equals() and hashCode()
    - Required for HashMap to work correctly
    - Added proper implementations based on accountId

3. **Thread Safety:**
    - Used ConcurrentHashMap to support concurrent access
    - Prepares for multi-threaded operations in Task 3

4. **Missing Validation:**
    - Added null checks and field validation
    - Proper exception handling per interface contract

### Changes Made:
- Implemented AccountKey.equals(), hashCode(), toString()
- Changed storage from ArrayList to ConcurrentHashMap
- Added comprehensive input validation in createAccount()
- Added test coverage for all functionality
